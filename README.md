# Virtual Cursor

Control your mouse cursor using eye gaze and blinks with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. This project demonstrates a simple eye‑tracking–based virtual mouse using a webcam.
🚀 Features
Real‑time eye tracking using MediaPipe Face Mesh
Smooth mouse movement mapped from gaze direction
Blink‑to‑click support
Works with a standard webcam
Lightweight and beginner‑friendly
🧰 Tech Stack
Python 3.8+
OpenCV – video capture & image processing
MediaPipe – facial landmark detection
PyAutoGUI – mouse control
📦 Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/GazePoint-Control.git
cd GazePoint-Control
Install dependencies:
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui
Note: On macOS, you may need to grant Accessibility and Camera permissions to your terminal/IDE for mouse control.
▶️ Usage
Connect your webcam.
Run the script:
python Virtual-Mouse.py
Sit facing the camera in a well‑lit environment.
Move your eyes to control the mouse cursor.
Blink intentionally to perform a mouse click.
🧠 How It Works
Captures frames from the webcam using OpenCV.
Detects facial landmarks (especially eye landmarks) via MediaPipe.
Estimates gaze direction from eye landmarks.
Maps gaze movement to screen coordinates.
Detects blinks and triggers mouse click events using PyAutoGUI.
